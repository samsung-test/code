How to use this Book? 
The simple answer is to read it, but this may mean different things to different people. If you are a Tizen enthusiast and want to know more; or if you are a beginner in contemporary technology, or if you are new to development, follow along, chapter by chapter, until you have all the basics you need to know Tizen better. In addition, if you are experienced, you might want to treat this book as more of a reference manual after going through the first chapter to get a feel for things throughout this work. This book may not have a huge appeal to those who are already established, veteran Tizen developers. As said before, I will start from a place that assumes you have no prior experience with this SDK.

Chapter 1
Tizen: Behind the Tizen Horizon  

In the contemporary information age, the digital experience revolution has led the sands of technology to the massive paradigm shift to digital technology, making traditional technology to tumble. As a result, smart and unbelievable hardware and software tools are evolving every day putting information on our fingertips. 
Having understood the benefits of digitising something, the soul of almost all the devices is the underlying software that makes it work. Undoubtedly, we use many devices in our daily lives but have you ever thought:
•	What makes our devices understand us?
•	Why our devices have different operating systems? 
•	What is the possibility to have a common operating system for all types of devices? 
To end the paradox, the answer is affirmative and the only operating system that meets the all the stated requirements is Tizen, also known as Operating System of Everything!   
Tizen© is a trademark of the Linux® Foundation, and is an open-source, web-centric, a cross-architecture software platform based on Linux. Tizen platform as an operating system fully supports all latest technical stacks, and runs on wide-range of devices with minimalistic required capabilities. Tizen operating system supports multi-device and multi-profile device taxonomies such as wearables, smartphones, tablets, netbooks, in-vehicle infotainment devices, smart TVs, and much more. 
Envisage the name “Tizen”, it is unique and true to its offerings. Even before you dig deeper in knowing more about Tizen, the following section got you covered with discovering the all-important name.   
Tizen: Discovering the Name
Primarily the basic nomenclature starts with a name, and thinking of a name that can become a verb as well as a noun, is iconic, and must add to the characteristic appeal. In addition, the name must also be perfecting the essence of operating system of everything in a broader perspective. It will not only take a sharp machete but also considerable time and an astute tracker to find such a name, and the search eventually ended on  five letter word “Tizen”.
The name “Tizen” is actually native to the country of its origin! South Korea. The name holds significance with respect to its meaning. So, what does the word Tizen mean? Is it a single syllable or collection of syllables? 
“Tizen”, combines together the  connectivity  of  “Tie”,  the  activity  of “Rise”, and the  meditative qualities  of “Zen”. Therefore, the name expresses more about connectedness with the aim of reaching the pinnacle of the tech world covering all the possible devices and qualities to stand out of the rest. Superlative as the name is, so is the statement “Tizen is the operating system of everything.” This argument would be incomplete without addressing and knowing the evolution of Tizen. 
The Boulevard to Evolution
Although, we see lot of other operating systems around and most of them are proprietary and the concept of open platform caught the eyes and has stood the test of the time. Meanwhile the origin of Tizen in itself has interesting course of twists and turns such as in: 
•	2005:  Nokia  developed  a  Debian  GNU-Linux  based platform that  includes Maemo operating system and  Software Development  Kit  (SDK).
•	2007: Motorola, NEC Corp., NTT DoCoMo, Panasonic Mobile Communications, Samsung Electronics, and Vodafone founded the LiMo Foundation in January 2007.
•	2010:  Nokia and  Intel  Corporation  announced  the  merging  of  Maemo software  platform  and  Intel’s Moblin  “mobile  Linux”  and was  named  MeeGo. 
•	2011: Nokia collaborated with Microsoft to create a global mobile ecosystem and chose Windows Operating System (OS) to run on Nokia devices. 
As the result of this partnership, Intel abandoned Meego and opted for Tizen to get a major mobile hardware partner. 
•	2011: Linux Foundation announces that MeeGo will be totally replaced by the Tizen.
•	2012: Tizen 1.0 released.
•	2013: Samsung officially announced retirement of Bada operating system (bada means “ocean in Korean”) and merged it into Tizen. 
•	Today, Linux Foundation is  hosting  Tizen  while  its  development  is completely open  and  lead  by  technical  team  composed  of  Intel  and Samsung known as Technical Steering Group. 
The evolution of Tizen over the years has seen Samsung and Intel to be the most vocal partners voicing for Tizen. The paradigm shift to open source is where Linux comes into play.

The Driving Force behind Tizen
Tizen project resides within the Linux Foundation. This Technical Steering Group (TSG) composes of Samsung and Intel among others to administer Tizen. TSG is the primary decision making body for the project and primarily focuses on its architecture and implementation, along with the formation of working groups to support other device verticals. The list of associated partners also includes eBay, Konami, Panasonic, Sharp, TrendMicro, TuneIn Radio, Sharp Electronics, and Panasonic to name a few. However, interesting fact is that the transition to Tizen took a lot of events to unfurl. Next section describes how that transition happened. 
The Transition to Tizen  
 


Did you know? 
The Tizen Association  was formerly The LiMo (Linux Mobile) Foundation is a non-profit technology consortium organization dedicated to creating Tizen as the first truly open, hardware-independent, Linux-based mobile operating system for smartphone mobile devices. 
Tizen: The Guiding Principles
The guiding principles behind Tizen are very basic to any open source software. The principles are as:
•	Openness
•	Optimization
•	Opportunities
The open source nature of Tizen opens it up for collaboration from any part of the globe, thus paves an open corridor for all communities to contribute to the development of Tizen. 
Adapting Tizen is very easy, because of its flexible SDK (Software Development Kit). You do not need to know anything new to get started.  
Tizen also offers a robust and flexible environment; since the number of Tizen based devices is on increase, it promises limitless opportunities to grow as Tizen stakeholder. 
Tizen: The Formal definition 
Tizen is an open and flexible operating system built from the ground up to address the needs of all stakeholders of the mobile and connected device ecosystem, including device manufacturers, mobile operators, application developers, and independent software vendors (ISVs). In the context of such wide-ranging list of devices, Tizen is also known as “Operating System of Everything.” This vision of everything aligns to the bigger objective in terms of IoT.

Tizen: Characteristic Fundamental Features
There are many features, but the fundamental features that catch the eye and make us a Tizen enthusiast are: 
•	Tizen is faster 
•	Tizen is lighter
Tizen offers incredible operational speeds and better transition effects as compared to other platforms. You will possibly never have to wait for responses and you will forget about application crashes. 
Integrated smart power management system in Tizen helps to minimize on power consumption. Tizen devices use fewer resources of CPU, memory and battery thus overcoming the biggest drawbacks of other platforms.  
Getting a Little Legal: The Licensing 
Primarily Tizen is open source software, although the SDK contains proprietary components owned by Samsung and components are licensed under the Flora License, a derivative of the Apache License 2.0 that only grants a patent license to "Tizen certified platforms. 
Also basic licenses such as GPLv2, LGPL, Apache License 2.0, BSD, SDK: Freeware apply.
